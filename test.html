            How do you create a new Git repository?
        </article>
        <article class="response">
            Creating a new Git repository involves a straightforward process. initialize a Git repository using the command git init. If your project already contains files, add them to the repository with git add ., staging them for the initial commit. After staging, commit the changes using git commit -m "Initial commit" along with a descriptive message.

            How do you stage changes in Git, and what is the purpose of staging?
        </article>
        <article class="response">
            To stage changes in Git, use the command `git add`. Staging is the process of preparing changes for the next commit. It allows you to selectively choose which modifications to include in the upcoming snapshot of your project's history. Staging provides granularity and control over which changes become part of the commit, helping you organize and commit only the relevant modifications while keeping others in the working directory.

            How do you merge branches in Git, and what is the purpose of merging?
        </article>
        <article class="response">
            To merge branches in Git, use the command git merge branch-name. Merging combines changes from one branch into another, typically bringing new features or bug fixes from a development branch to the main branch. it helps to  keep code organized and ensur that diverse contributions come together cohesively in the final project.

            How do you resolve conflicts in Git when merging branches?
        </article>
        <article class="response">
            When merging branches in Git, conflicts may arise when changes in the branches cannot be automatically reconciled. To resolve conflicts, initiate the merge with git pull or git merge, and Git will signal conflicted files. Manually edit these files to address differences, then use git add filename to mark them as resolved. Finally, complete the merge with git commit -m "Merge message".

            How do you push changes from your local repository to a remote repository, and what is the purpose of pushing?
        </article>
        <article class="response">
            To push changes from your local repository to a remote repository in Git, use the command git push origin branch-name. Pushing is the process of uploading your committed changes to a shared remote repository, enabling collaboration and synchronization among team members. It ensures that the latest code modifications are available to others, facilitating teamwork and maintaining a centralized and up-to-date codebase.

            How do you fetch and merge changes from a remote repository, and what is the purpose of fetching?
        </article>
        <article class="response">
            To fetch and merge changes from a remote repository in Git, use `git fetch origin` to retrieve updates without merging immediately. After fetching, use `git merge origin/<branch-name>` to incorporate changes into your local branch. Fetching allows you to inspect updates before merging, providing control over when and how you integrate remote changes. It ensures that your local repository stays synchronized with the remote, enabling a smooth collaboration process without immediately altering your working directory.
